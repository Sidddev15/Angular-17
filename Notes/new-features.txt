# Angular 17 New Features

## SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

Before Angular 17:
- Server-side rendering (SSR) required complex setups and configurations using tools like Angular Universal.
- Developers had to manually handle the rendering process, which could lead to performance issues and higher latency.

After Angular 17:
- SSR is now simplified with improved Angular Universal integration, making setup straightforward.
- Automatic handling of rendering processes, resulting in faster load times and better SEO out of the box.
- Enhanced server-side support reduces the boilerplate code, making it easier to get started with SSR in Angular applications.

## Control Flow Syntax

Before Angular 17:
- Control flow syntax was limited, requiring multiple `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` directives that could lead to verbose and cluttered templates.
- Developers had to rely on complex workarounds to manage conditional rendering and iterations.

After Angular 17:
- Introduction of a new control flow syntax that allows for more intuitive and concise template structures.
- Examples:
  - Using `*ngIf` with `else` blocks:

    <div *ngIf="isLoggedIn; else login">
      Welcome back!
    </div>
    <ng-template #login>
      Please log in.
    </ng-template>


  - Simplified conditional classes:

    <div [ngClass]="{'active': isActive, 'inactive': !isActive}">Status</div>

## Deferable Views

Before Angular 17:
- Rendering of complex views was done upfront, leading to slower initial load times and increased resource consumption.
- Developers needed to manage view loading manually to optimize performance.

After Angular 17:
- Introduction of deferable views allows for lazy loading of components based on user interactions.
- Views can be loaded only when required, enhancing performance and user experience by reducing initial load times.

## More Stable Signals

Before Angular 17:
- Change detection and updates in the application could be unpredictable, especially in larger applications.
- Developers had to rely on manual triggers for certain updates, leading to potential bugs.

After Angular 17:
- Angular now provides more stable signals for change detection, ensuring that components are updated in a predictable manner.
- This stability results in fewer bugs and a smoother user experience as the application grows.

## Better Build Performance

Before Angular 17:
- Build times were longer, particularly in larger projects, leading to slower development cycles.
- Developers often faced challenges with incremental builds, requiring full rebuilds for minor changes.

After Angular 17:
- Angular 17 includes performance optimizations that significantly reduce build times.
- Enhanced incremental build capabilities allow developers to see changes faster, boosting productivity and efficiency during development.
