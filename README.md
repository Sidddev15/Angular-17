## Lesson 1: Getting Started with Angular üöÄ

### Step 1: Installing Node.js

To start working with Angular, you need **Node.js** installed on your system. Node.js provides the runtime environment for Angular's development and build processes.

1. **Download Node.js**:  
   Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the **LTS version** (recommended for most users).

2. **Install Node.js**:  
   Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.

3. **Verify Installation**:  
   Once installed, open your terminal/command prompt and verify that Node.js is installed correctly by running:
   ```bash
   node -v

### Step 2: Installing Angular CLI

Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is the essential tool for creating and managing Angular applications. It simplifies the setup, development, and build process.

1. **Install Angular CLI globally using npm**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli

2. **Verify Angular CLI Installation**:
   ```bash
   ng version

### Step 3: Creating a New Angular Project

1. **Creating a New Angular Project**:
   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-angular-app

3. **Serve the Angular application**:
   ```bash
   ng serve
